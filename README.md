# NYC-ML-Project

## Overview
This project is based around real-world data from New York City. The goal is to explore the data, make some predictions and draw conclusions. 

The project is evolving - more datasets are being analized. Right now it consists of:

- **NYC Parking Fines** (analyzes NYC parking violations data (Fiscal Year 2015) to understand violation patterns and predict fine categories based on vehicle and violation characteristics)

- **NYC Citibike** (analyzes and predicts Citibike usage based on calendar and weather)




.
