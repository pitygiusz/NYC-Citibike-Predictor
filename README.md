# NYC Parking Violations Project

## Overview
This project analyzes NYC parking violations data (Fiscal Year 2015) to understand violation patterns and predict fine categories based on vehicle and violation characteristics. The original Jupyter Notebook has been refactored into a modular Python project for better maintainability and scalability.

## Data Source

The project requires the **NYC Parking Violations Issued - Fiscal Year 2015** dataset. You can download it from Kaggle:

[NYC Parking Tickets on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets)

Please download the `Parking_Violations_Issued_-_Fiscal_Year_2015.csv` file and place it in a directory accessible to the script (`/archive`).

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites**: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.
2.  **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

Run the entire pipeline (Data Loading -> Preprocessing -> EDA -> Modeling):
```bash
python3 run.py
```

### Options
- **Skip EDA** (faster execution):
  ```bash
  python3 run.py --no-eda
  ```
- **Enable Hyperparameter Tuning** (GridSearchCV):
  ```bash
  python3 run.py --tune
  ```
- **Specify Custom Paths**:
  ```bash
  python3 run.py --violations path/to/file.csv --codes path/to/codes.csv
  ```
